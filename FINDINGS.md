# Olympic Medals Analysis: Key Findings

## Dataset Overview
- The dataset contains 15,433 medal records from Summer Olympics (1976-2008)
- There are 1,287 missing values across the dataset
- The dataset includes 11 columns with information about athletes, countries, sports, and medals

## Medal Distribution
- Bronze medals (5,258) slightly outnumber Gold (5,042) and Silver (5,016)
- This is expected as some team events award multiple bronze medals

## Top Countries
1. United States (1,992 medals)
2. Soviet Union (1,021 medals)
3. Australia (798 medals)
4. Germany (691 medals)
5. China (679 medals)

The United States has consistently been the top performer, with nearly twice as many medals as the second-place country.

## Gender Distribution
- Men: 61.3% of medals
- Women: 38.7% of medals

This shows a significant gender difference in Olympic medal distribution, though women's participation has increased over time.

## Medals by Year
- 1976: 1,305 medals
- 2008: 2,042 medals

The number of medals awarded has increased by 56% from 1976 to 2008, reflecting the growth in Olympic events and participation.

## Top Sports
1. Aquatics (2,210 medals)
2. Athletics (1,523 medals)
3. Rowing (1,377 medals)
4. Hockey (817 medals)
5. Gymnastics (783 medals)

Aquatics and Athletics consistently award the most medals due to their numerous events and disciplines.

## Predictive Model
- Our Random Forest model achieved 72% accuracy in predicting gold medals
- Top predictive features:
  1. Gender (Women) - 10.1% importance
  2. Sport (Rowing) - 4.7% importance
  3. Country (United States) - 4.5% importance
  4. Sport (Handball) - 3.6% importance
  5. Sport (Hockey) - 3.2% importance

Interestingly, being a female athlete is the strongest predictor of winning a gold medal (vs. silver/bronze). This suggests that while women win fewer medals overall, they may have a higher proportion of gold medals when they do win.

## Conclusions
1. The Olympics have grown significantly over the studied period (1976-2008)
2. There is a persistent gender difference in medal distribution
3. A few countries dominate the medal counts, with the United States being the leader
4. Aquatics and Athletics are the biggest medal contributors
5. Country of origin and gender are strong predictors of medal outcomes

These findings highlight both the global nature of the Olympics and the continuing differences in participation and success rates across different demographics and nations.
